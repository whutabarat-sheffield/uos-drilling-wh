3. **GUI Complexity**: Phased rollout with basic ‚Üí advanced GUI features
4. **Integration Complexity**: Feature flags enable gradual training platform integration

### **Timeline Risks**
1. **GUI Development**: Start with CLI-only workflows, add GUI incrementally
2. **Cloud Integration**: Begin with local training, add cloud support in v2.0.2
3. **Algorithm Flexibility**: Start with PatchTSMixer, add new strategies in v2.0.x

This comprehensive roadmap provides a clear evolution path that integrates the training platform with our existing development trajectory, ensuring backward compatibility while building toward a complete ML platform for drilling depth estimation.
