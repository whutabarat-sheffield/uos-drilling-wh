## Project Context

### Current State: v0.2.5
The UOS Drilling System is a deep learning platform for drilling depth estimation that has evolved from a proof-of-concept to a production-ready inference system. The current version (v0.2.5) provides:

- **Dual Architecture**: Sync (`mqtt/components/`) and async (`mqtt/async_components/`) processing
- **Enhanced Duplicate Handling**: Configurable message deduplication with three modes
- **Build Automation**: Comprehensive Docker build scripts and Makefile integration
- **Configuration Management**: Type-safe configuration system with validation
- **24-fold Cross-Validation**: Robust model training and evaluation pipeline

### Development Evolution
The project has undergone significant consolidation and improvement:

**Historical Context:**
- **v0.2.4**: Legacy code consolidation (25+ modules moved to `abyss/legacy/`)
- **v0.2.5**: Enhanced duplicate handling and build automation
- **Current Focus**: Training platform development and architecture optimization

**Technical Debt Addressed:**
- ‚úÖ Configuration patterns unified with ConfigurationManager
- ‚úÖ Build system partially Makefile-based (ongoing improvement)
- ‚úÖ MessageBuffer enhanced with ConfigurationManager integration
- ‚úÖ Docker image optimization (CPU: ~3.5GB, GPU: ~13GB)
- üîÑ Architecture duplication (sync/async) - planned for v0.3+ migration

## Project Vision

### Short-term Goals (v0.3.x)
1. **Complete Makefile Migration**: Unified build system
2. **Async-First Architecture**: Eliminate sync/async duplication
3. **Training Platform MVP**: Basic annotation and retraining capabilities

### Long-term Vision (v1.0+)
Transform from inference-only platform to complete ML training and deployment ecosystem:

- **Hybrid Labeling System**: Auto step-code extraction + expert validation GUI
- **Dataset Management**: Support for 300 labeled + 1000 unlabeled holes
- **User-Friendly Interface**: GUI annotation tool + CLI batch processing
- **Platform Integration**: MLflow + DVC stack
- **Production Deployment**: Optimized for Portainer multi-stack environments
