# Training Feature Analysis: Deep Learning Model Retraining Capability

## Feature Request Overview

**Objective**: Enable end users to perform their own training and retraining of the deep learning depth estimation models.

**Key Requirements**:
- Dual codebase: PyTorch for training, ONNX for deployment
- End-user training tools and workflows  
- Comprehensive guidance for data organization and labeling
- Integration with existing inference system

## Architectural Implications

### Current System Analysis
- **Existing Models**: 72 PatchTSMixer models (24 CV folds × 3 files) = 135MB total
- **Current Usage**: Inference-only with pre-trained models
- **Input Data**: Position, Torque, Thrust, Step traces from drilling operations
- **Output**: Three-point depth estimation (entry, transition, exit)

## Critical Clarification Questions

### 1. Training Data Structure & Requirements

**Q1**: What is the expected training data format and structure?
- Should we support the same XLS format as current inference system?
- What's the minimum dataset size for effective training?
- How should different drilling configurations be handled (separate models vs unified model)?

**Q2**: What are the specific input features and target labels?
- Input features: Position, Torque, Thrust, Step - are these sufficient?
- Target labels: How are ground truth depth points (entry/transition/exit) determined?
- Should we support additional sensor data or drilling parameters?

**Q3**: Data quality and preprocessing requirements?
- What data validation and cleaning steps are needed?
- Should we provide automated data quality checks?
- How should outliers and anomalous drilling operations be handled?

### 2. Model Architecture & Training Strategy

**Q4**: Model architecture flexibility?
- Should we stick with PatchTSMixer or allow architecture selection?
- Support for transfer learning from existing pre-trained models?
- Should ensemble training (current 24-fold CV) be mandatory or optional?

**Q5**: Training methodology and validation?
- Cross-validation strategy - fixed 24-fold or user-configurable?
- Hyperparameter tuning - automated (AutoML) or manual configuration?
- Training stopping criteria and performance thresholds?

**Q6**: Computational requirements and training time?
- Expected training duration (hours/days/weeks)?
- GPU requirements and cloud training support?
- Resource management and cost optimization?

### 3. User Experience & Target Audience

**Q7**: Target user profile and technical expertise?
- Data scientists, drilling engineers, or operators?
- Required ML knowledge level?
- Preferred interface: CLI, GUI, Jupyter notebooks, or web interface?

**Q8**: Training workflow and automation level?
- Fully automated pipeline vs step-by-step guided process?
- Integration with existing data sources and databases?
- Batch training vs interactive experimentation?

### 4. Model Lifecycle & Deployment

**Q9**: Model management and versioning?
- Model versioning strategy and storage requirements?
- A/B testing framework for comparing model performance?
- Rollback procedures for underperforming models?

**Q10**: Production deployment workflow?
- Automated PyTorch → ONNX conversion and validation?
- Model hot-swapping in production without downtime?
- Performance monitoring and drift detection?

### 5. Integration with Current Roadmap

**Q11**: Version planning and timeline?
- Should this be integrated into existing v1.x roadmap or planned as v2.x?
- Backward compatibility requirements with existing pre-trained models?
- Feature flag approach for gradual rollout?

**Q12**: Infrastructure and resource requirements?
- Training infrastructure requirements (local, cloud, hybrid)?
- Storage requirements for training data, models, and experiments?
- Monitoring and logging for training processes?
