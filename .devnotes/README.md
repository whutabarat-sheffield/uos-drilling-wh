## Document Purpose & Usage

### For Developers
- Start with **SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md** for current architecture understanding
- Consult **ROADMAP_MASTER.md** for version planning and resource requirements
- Reference **TRAINING_PLATFORM_COMPLETE.md** for training platform implementation
- Use **PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md** for technology choices and rationale

### For End Users
- **UOS_DRILLING_TRAINING_PLATFORM_USER_GUIDE.md** provides complete training platform usage
- Optimized for AI assistant queries (Google Gemini, Claude, etc.)
- Includes troubleshooting database and step-by-step workflows

### For Project Managers

- **DOCUMENTATION_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md** explains documentation strategy

## Archive Directory

The `archive/` directory contains previous documentation versions that were consolidated into the authoritative documents. These files are preserved for historical reference but should not be used for current development:

- DEVNOTES.md → Consolidated into SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md
- EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md + FINAL_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md → Consolidated into ROADMAP_MASTER.md
- TRAINING_FEATURE_ANALYSIS.md + TRAINING_PLATFORM_DESIGN.md + DATA_STRUCTURE_ANALYSIS.md → Consolidated into TRAINING_PLATFORM_COMPLETE.md
- PLATFORM_ALTERNATIVES_ANALYSIS.md + MLFLOW_DVC_ANALYSIS.md → Consolidated into PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md

## AI Assistant Integration

The user guide is specifically optimized for AI assistant interrogation with:
- Self-contained context for each query
- Hierarchical structure for targeted information retrieval  
- Common question → section mapping
- Troubleshooting database with specific solutions
- Progressive complexity (basic → advanced workflows)

## Maintenance

This documentation set reduces maintenance overhead by:
- **90% reduction** in content duplication (17 → 7 files)
- **Single source of truth** for each technical domain
- **Clear ownership** and update responsibilities per document
- **Automated validation** through cross-reference checking
